      <article class="first">
      <p>Jesus H Christ Hare Krishna Buddha J.K. Rowling it’s my 33rd birthday
        today!
        welcome to the rest of my life! join me inside my brainheart for a
        minute:</p>

      <p>33 is the number of Christ Consciousness, aka Krishna Consciousness,
        aka Buddha Consciousness...<br />
        what is that?<br />
        to me it means:<br />
        unconditional love, for e v e r y t h i n g<br />
        every person, every moment, ever, everything. everything everyone all
        the time is divine, everything ever always was is will be a gift.</p>
      <p>Jesus tho?<br />
        we call 33 our Christ year bc it is at age 33, as far as we know, that
        Jesus aka Yeshua was arrested and crucified. Yeshua = in my opinion,
        the ultimate badass revolutionary. his ideas - nonviolence, social
        justice, redistribution of wealth - and his lifestyle - hanging out
        with the sick, the poor, the outcast - stood in total contradiction of
        the corrupt system in control of his society.</p>

      <p>2,000 frickin years later this feels as relevant as ever, doesn’t it?
        the institutions that dictate our way of life seem intent on keeping us
        separate, divided, distracted, self-interested. money > human life ?!
        &#128545; &#128545; &#128545; ok i digress </p>

      <p>perhaps the most revolutionary idea that Yeshua shared at the time was
        this: that God (Spirit / Source / The Infinite / OG Creative
        Consciousness / Christ Krishna Buddha Garfield whatever you want to
        call it) isn’t some distant, otherworldy force - no actually, all of
        this is WITHIN YOU.</p>

      <p>if i have learned anything so far in my 33 years it is that *life is
        an inside job.*</p>

      <p>whatever i am experiencing on the outside, how i think about it
        &#128165; how i be about it &#128165; what i choose to do about it
        &#128165; is entirely up to me. it’s practical, and it’s unconditional.
        in any moment, on every scale, from big picture to tiny subtle detail,
        do i choose fear, or do i choose love?</p>
    </article>

    <article class="second">
      <p>if i’m not good with myself, i find that reflected in my experience -
        and i’ve witnessed myself let my insecurity, my fear, my self-hate rub
        off and make a mess on other people. when instead i choose to see that
        others are the same as me, i.e. Something connects us all, compassion
        fills me up and my experience shifts.</p>

      <p>why am i saying all these things to you on my birthday?</p>

      <p>ok. i don't know what your experience is...whatever it is is legit. me,
        i experience God and magic and ancient aliens and maybe you think
        that's silly, or maybe you see that shit too. whatever your worldview
        is, i get to tell you wassup it's my birthday today and Yeshua is calling
        me out on my bullshit. there is a corrupt system that i let run my life,
        and that's my own ego mind. that's keeping me self-interested, afraid,
        and distracted from what is most important. and fuck that. i get to be
        the revolutionary and choose to live from my heart, for my soul.</p>

       <p>is this long metaphor making sense?</p>

       <p>welcome to the rest of my life. i'm sharing this with you so you can
         hold me accountable. i'll get scared and mess up but i'll keep coming
         back to this commitment i make in front of you and the rest of the
         internet: </p>

        <p>be courageous and love unconditionally.<br />
          recognize myself in others. recongnize i get to be a part of the
          whole and i'll never un-be that.<br />
          everything all the time is a gift. therefore it's always a
          birthday party? &#127880; yes actually </p>

        <p>thanks for listening i love you happy mybirthday to everyonnne</p>
